## Overview

It's my solution for the problem 1.2 "Ð†mplement minimum and maximum values". This is a function that takes array with length of 5 and returns an array of length 2, where the first element is minimum sum and second is maximum sum. Also it prints min and max sum to stdout.
It was tested using `testify` package

## How to run
Clone the repository if you want to run the test:

    git clone https://git.foxminded.ua/foxstudent106264/task-1.2.git
    go test

Or `go get` it:

    go get git.foxminded.ua/foxstudent106264/task-1.2

And import to your project to use the function:

    import "git.foxminded.ua/foxstudent106264/task-1.2"
